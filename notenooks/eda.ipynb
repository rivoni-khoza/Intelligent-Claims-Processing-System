    "\n",
    "- Identifying and handling missing values.\n",
    "- Analyzing the distribution of claims by **age, gender, location, and injury type**.\n",
    "- Exploring **temporal trends** such as accident dates and claim delays.\n",
    "- Engineering new features like **age groups** and **months** to extract deeper insights.\n",
    "- Highlighting key business areas like **high-volume districts**, **frequent injury types**, and **claim status outcomes**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Claim Volume and Distribution  \n",
    "Most claims fall under the category of **workers compensation claims**, while non-workers compensation claims are minimal. \n",
    "Geographically,</br>\n",
    "**New York City (NYC)** dominates in claim volume, far ahead of other districts like Long Island and Albany.</br>\n",
    "This suggests a strong concentration of workplace-related incidents in urban centers. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **30–44 age group** emerged as the most active in filing claims, followed by 45–59 and under 18,</br>\n",
    " reflecting typical working-age and dependent populations. The top injury types were:\n",
    "- `non-comp`\n",
    "- `temporary`\n",
    "- `ppd sch loss`\n",
    "\n",
    "These injury categories indicate the prevalence of minor to moderate injuries, which are common in workplace environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temporal Trends  \n",
    "Claims surged between **2000 and 2020**, showing a significant increase in reporting or incidents during that period.</br> \n",
    "Notably, **September** recorded the highest monthly claims, hinting at potential seasonality in claim occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Averages in **claim delays** varied across days and months. This insight is based on an engineered `month` </br>\n",
    "feature derived from `accident_date`, enabling us to capture seasonal trends and administrative inefficiencies more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demographic Patterns  \n",
    "Gender analysis revealed that **males are significantly more likely to file injury claims**,</br>\n",
    "particularly for non-comp and temporary injuries. Female claimants were underrepresented across all injury types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The age distribution, powered by an engineered `age group` feature, confirmed that</br>\n",
    "**younger and middle-aged adults** are the most frequent claimants.</br>\n",
    "These insights reinforce the link between claim activity and employment status or exposure to physical work environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing Data Patterns  \n",
    "A review of missingness showed that some columns, such as `wcio_cause_of_injury_desc` and `wcio_nature_of_injury_desc`, </br>\n",
    "had over **95% missing values** and were excluded from further analysis. However,</br>\n",
    "columns like `accident_date`—although incomplete—were retained and labeled as `\"Unknown\"` due to their analytical relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing data varied by claim type, with **workers compensation claims** having more complete records, making them more reliable for further modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Claim Status Insights  \n",
    "The majority of claims resulted in either **\"no further action\"** or were **\"administratively closed\"**,</br>\n",
    "showing that most cases are resolved without requiring legal escalation. Very few claims progressed to hearings or motions,</br>\n",
    "indicating efficient internal processing or low dispute rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways  \n",
    "- **NYC and working-age males** are central to claim activity.  \n",
    "- Seasonality and timing can influence volume and delay—vital for triaging and staffing.  \n",
    "- **Engineered features** like `month` and `age group` revealed actionable patterns.  \n",
    "- **Missing data** is manageable but requires selective cleaning and imputation.  \n",
    "- This foundational analysis prepares the ground for **predictive modeling**, such as risk scoring, fraud detection, or delay estimation.\n",
